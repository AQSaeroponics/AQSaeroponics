                    <p>Today the potato is the third most important crop in the world in terms of food consumption, after rice and wheat, and hundreds of millions of people in developing countries depend on potatoes for their survival. More than 156 countries produce potatoes and more than a billion people worldwide eat them on a regular basis. 
According to UN projections, the world population will reach the 8 billion mark by 2050. The UN expects that more than 95% of this increase will occur in developing countries, where the pressures on earth, water, and other natural resources are already intense. The potato produces more food on less land faster than any other major food crop and, as a result, potato crops are an excellent alternative for farmers who need to feed growing populations with limited areas of crop land. One hectare of potatoes can yield a crop with a food value of more than four hectares of grain. Potatoes also yield twice the protein per hectare of wheat. Potatoes production in developing countries faces challenges like poor soil fertility, pests, diseases, and a limited supply of quality seed tubers, mainly due to weaknesses in the seed system. Aeroponic system is applied intensively for the purpose of growing potato in order to produce disease-free potato seed and in order to have a pesticides-free cultivation environment. It is also predicted that the aeroponic method will be able to lower potato farmers' cost of operation and increase their yields. This keeps the seeds disease-free, reduces pesticides, and saves water and fertilizer. It also helps farmers lower costs and increase their potato field.

                    When Serge Gander realized how much food is wasted worldwide every year – about 1.3 billion tons – he was appalled. But one particular type of food waste caught his attention: leafy greens. According to one study, 7 out of 10 salads never make it onto the supermarkets shelves or sandwiches. Transporting fragile lettuce from distant farms can lead to spoilage and increased carbon footprint.To solve this problem aeroponics enables hyper-local production, reducing transportation distances and preserving freshness.It also allows you to grow for maximum taste, rather than to ensure crops survive a long journey to the supermarket.The moving plates of lettuce are constantly replenished. As soon as they are picked, they are replanted! And this is done throughout the year. This promises a yield 30 times higher than traditional crops. Leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach thrive in aeroponic systems. They grow faster, absorb more nutrients, and require less land, making them a sustainable choice.</p>
