            <h2>What is Aeroponics?</h2>
            <p>Aeroponics is a promising soilless farming method for solving future food crisis and is relatively a new way of growing plants that is getting increasingly popular with many people because of the speed, cost and novelty. Aeroponic farming is a form of hydroponic technique and a type of vertical farming. The word aeroponic is derived from the Latin word ‚Äòaero‚Äô(air) and ‚Äòponic‚Äô means labour (work). This farming system empowered the producer to precisely control root zone nutrients, water regimes, and environmental conditions and have complete access to the roots throughout the life of the crop. This aeroponic farming is superior in terms of excellent aeration, water use efficiency, less time and space requirement, seasonal independence, disease free plant propagation, and large scale plant production etc. than the conventional methods of propagation. Aeroponic techniques have proven to be commercially successful for propagation, seed germination, seed potato production, tomato production, leaf crops, and micro-greens. Vegetable crops like potato, yams, tomato, lettuce and some of the leafy vegetables are being commercially cultivated in aeroponic system. Aeroponics appeared to be a highly feasible method for the production of both aerial parts and roots.</p>
